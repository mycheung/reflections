How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It's much faster and I don't have to think.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I don't have to worry about losing anything I've ever worked on in the past.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Each change is logical and just the right size so the versions are easier to look back on.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because the files are interconnected.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows general information of all the commits.
git diff shows the differences in detail between 2 commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because I could easily go back to previous versions. It makes tracing a whole lot easier, which is handy in debugging.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I'll use it for version control and for all dev-related work.
