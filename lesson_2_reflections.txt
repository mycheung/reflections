What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It makes the current directory a git repository. This is so that git recognizes that this is a repository and start tracking changes of files committed.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a temporary location in which you can specify which files you want to include in the commit so that only the files you want to commit are committed. There might be some files in the directory you don't want to include in the commit.
